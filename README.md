## About

A Twitter clone and a remake of this app [https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter](https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter) with these features:

- Written with React (original project written in JQuery)
- Fully Modular Components: Header, Modal, Button
- Login Feature: User can like other tweets, and delete their own tweets.
- Users can like or dislike tweets

The purpose of remaking this app is to practice:

- Using RESTful routes (Add, edit, delete a tweet)
- Using React hooks with Forms
- Form Validation for User Login
