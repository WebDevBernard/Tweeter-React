## About

A simple Twitter clone and a remake of this app made at Lighthouse Labs: [https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter](https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter). The main purpose of this project is to create components and styling that can be reused in future projects. It has the following features:

- Written with modern React tools, using reuseable components: Modal, Button, Input, TextArea, Card, Header, Footer.
- User content saved to localStorage. Tweets can also be liked/disliked or deleted.
- Username is randomized on refresh or when user "signs up".
- Sign-up is not a real sign-up as it is not storing any user data.  This feature is just used to test form validation with multiple inputs.
