## About

- My attempt to make a pixel perfect clone of the Twitter home page, made using React and Tailwind CSS. Users can also login with Firebase, update avatar, tweet, comment, like or delete a tweet. I made this website to practice things I learned in React tutorials, including React Redux and Context, and React with TypeScript. State persisted through local storage.

## Tech Stack

- Firebase authentication to manage user login
- React state management using Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Formik and Yup for form Vaildation
- Unique Names Generator to create randomize user names
- react-timeago for time formatting
