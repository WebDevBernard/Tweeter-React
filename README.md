## About

- A clone of Twitter home screen with Firebase authentication, Redux state management and reusable React components.

- I initially made this app to practice CSS, structuring a React project and creating multiple reusable components. I added additional features over time such as persisting data through local storage, adding login feature, commenting system, a like toggle. I also wanted to practice different state management systems (including Redux), with my first iteration of this app using only props drilling. Later when I added the like toggle, I switched to Context API. Finally, when I added the commenting system, I moved everything to Redux toolkit.

- Currently working on v2: New tailwind css styling to match twitter home page. Converted to TypeScript. Writing custom hook for comments and tweets.

## Tech Stack

- Firebase authentication to manage user login
- React state management using Redux Toolkit
- Formik and Yup for form Vaildation
- Unique Names Generator to create randomize user names
- MomentJS for "time ago"
