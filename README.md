## About
- A simple Twitter-like React app with Firebase authentication. Users can tweet, like, and comment on other tweets. 

- I initially made this app to practice structuring a React project and creating multiple reusable components.   I added additional features over time such as persisting data through local storage, adding login feature, commenting system, a like toggle.  I also wanted to practice different state management systems (including Redux), with my first iteration of this app using only props drilling.  Later when I added the like toggle, I switched to Context API.  Finally, when I added the commenting system, I moved everything to Redux toolkit.  

- The design of this project is based on a project I made at coding bootcamp: [https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter](https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter).  I did not use any of the original code, I just used it as design reference for this project.

## Tech Stack

- Firebase authentication to manage user login
- React state management using Redux Toolkit
- Formik and Yup for form Vaildation
