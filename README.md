## About

A simple Twitter clone and a remake of this app made at Lighthouse Labs: [https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter](https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter). I made this project to practice React with Redux, Context, and useReducer. It has the following features:

- Written with modern React tools, using reuseable components: Modal, Button, Card, Input, Header, Footer.
- User content saved to localStorage. Tweets can also be liked/disliked or deleted.
- Sign in with Firebase using Formik and Yup for validation

add api for redux and reducer
add protected profile route
