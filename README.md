## About

A simple Twitter clone and a remake of this app made at Lighthouse Labs: [https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter](https://github.com/WebDevBernard/tweeter). I made this project to practice React with Redux, Context, useReducer. It has the following features:

- Written with modern React tools, using reuseable components: Modal, Button, Card, Header, Footer.
- User content saved to localStorage. Tweets can also be liked/disliked or deleted.
- Username is randomized on refresh or when user "signs up".
- Firrebase login to be implemented.
